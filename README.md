Breakweb
========
  
a breakout game for giant mainframes, and everything else. 

  
It's a fun breakout game, written in Go and javascript. I chose these two languages because they are also availabe on z/OS. However, this game runs pretty much on everything with a live heartbeat.   
  

Install the game
================  
clone the repo and then start the game with:
<pre>go run breakweb.go</pre>  
With any web browser connect to localhost:8080/  

To change the port, change the code in breakweb.go to any port you desire and then run the program again.   


How to play the game
====================
     
R to resume  
Q to quit the game  
'- to slow down the ball'  
'+ to accelerate the ball'  
P to pause and unpause the game  
B for Boss key - pauses the game and displays some boring code
